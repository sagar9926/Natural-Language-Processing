        "Intuitively, to understand what text is about, we look for words that occur frequently. Term frequency covers that aspect by capturing the number of times each word occurs in the text. However, in this article, there are 200+ occurrences of the word ‘the’ and only 55 occurrences of the word TF (which includes the code used as well). To downgrade the relative importance of words that occur all too frequently, an inverse weighting is introduced to scale down the words that occur too frequently. This inverse weighting is referred to as Inverse Document Frequency. Together, TF-IDF captures the relative importance of words in a set of documents or a collection of texts.\n",

        "In an applied business context, the text classification problem is one of the common problems in NLP. In text classification problems, the algorithms have to predict the topic based on a predefined set of topics it has trained on. In 2018, Google released a text classification framework based on 450K experiments on a few different text sets. Based on the 450K experiments, Google found that when the number of samples/number of words < 1500, TF IDF was the best way to represent text. When you have a smallish sample size for a relatively common problem, it helps to try out TF IDF.\n",
